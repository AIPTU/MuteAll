A PocketMine-MP plugin to mute all players on the server.

# Features

- `Global Chat Mute`: Enable a global chat mute for all players on the server, preventing them from sending chat messages.
- `Bypass Permission`: Allow players with the `muteall.bypass` permission to chat even during global mute.
- `Customizable Messages`: Personalize messages displayed to players when they attempt to chat during global mute and when the mute is turned on or off.
- `Color Formatting`: The messages can be colored using "ยง" or "&" color codes, providing visual appeal and customization options for the messages.
- `Config Version Management`: The plugin ensures that the configuration file is up-to-date. If an outdated config file is provided, it generates a new one and backs up the old config, preventing compatibility issues.
- `User-friendly Command`: Use the simple `/muteall` command to toggle the global chat mute on or off easily.
